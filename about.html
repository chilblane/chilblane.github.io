                <h3>Axosoft product site</h3>
                <p><a href='https://www.axosoft.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>www.axosoft.com</a></p>
                <p>Axosoft.com is the marketing site for the Axosoft product, but includes some company-specific pages. As project manager and lead designer, I worked with other members of the marketing team to create designs, copy, graphics, and code.</p>
                <p>Axosoft.com was the first project to use a new CSS framework I wrote called Axostyle. This framework is now in place across many of Axosoft's web properties.</p>
                <p>The website, especially the index page and the trial signup page, underwent constant improvement. I used Google Analytics and other tools to look for new opportunities to improve the lead acquisition funnel.</p>

                <h3>Axosoft blog</h3>
                <p><a href='https://blog.axosoft.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>blog.axosoft.com</a></p>
                <p>The Axosoft blog redesign was a fun and challenging project. My goal was to modernize the home of Axosoft's new content strategy, while adhering to the Axostyle principles that established their online brand. I worked with the in-house Wordpress developer to come up with a theme that was not only a great experience for readers, but easy to use for editors, too.</p>

                <h3>Axosoft support site</h3>
                <p><a href='https://support.axosoft.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>support.axosoft.com</a></p>
                <p>Axosoft had a pressing need for product documentation that was easy to navigate and search, and easy to maintain solely by their support team. We identified a static site generator and server that compiled Markdown articles into pages and adapted it to Axostyle.</p>
                <p>A matching <a href='https://support.gitkraken.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>GitKraken support site</a> was later released.</p>

                <p><a href='https://www.gitkraken.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>www.gitkraken.com</a></p>
                <p>GitKraken.com is the marketing site for the new Git GUI app. From an aesthetic perspective, this site was very experimental and unusual to capture the GitKraken branding. It was also an ongoing design challenge as its requirements and content grew based on the product's needs.</p>
