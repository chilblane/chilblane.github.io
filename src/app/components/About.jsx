        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m a web designer and developer focused on marketing
          and product sites, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, and currently
          looking for new opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&rsquo;m passionate about consistency, scalability, and
          performance. I believe your web presence and application is
          your brand, your users are your top priority, and even the
          smallest details are important.
        </p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <h3>Marketing web design</h3>
        <p>
          I create brand experiences that delight, inform, and
          encourage website visitors to convert into users, utilizing
          modern and responsible practices and UX.
        </p>
        <h3>Front-end development</h3>
        <p>
          My extensive experience with HTML and CSS enables me to write
          effective and flexible styling frameworks and pages. I
          prioritize performance, progressive enhancement, and
          maintainability.
        </p>
        <h3>Cross-departmental UX</h3>
        <p>
          User experience isn&rsquo;t contained to just your website and app.
          I&rsquo;ve worked hard to ensure any time a user interacts with a
          brand, they receive the same fantastic experience, be it
          transactional emails, social media, documentation, and more.
