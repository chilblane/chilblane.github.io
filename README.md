# chilblane.github.io
My personal website in development.

Now built with Grunt and Jekyll.

## Installation

Because the site uses Jekyll and Grunt, you'll need to make sure you have Ruby and Node.js installed.

More instructions whenever, once I actually try clone and install this repo in a fresh environment.
