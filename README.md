# chilblane.github.io
My personal website in development.

Now built with Grunt and Jekyll.

## Installation

Because the site uses Jekyll and Grunt, you'll need to make sure you have Ruby and Node.js installed.

Once you've done so:

1. Install Grunt CLI: `npm i -g grunt-cli`
2. Install Bundler: `gem install bundler`
3. Install ruby gems: `bundle install`
4. Install node modules: `npm i`

## Building and running

`grunt` will build the site and serve it to `http://localhost:9000`.
You can split these tasks into `grunt build` and `grunt serve`.

## Acknowledgments

The website uses the following code, snippets, and guides:

- jQuery
- [jQuery.scrollTo](https://github.com/flesler/jquery.scrollTo)
- [`function check_if_in_view()`](https://www.sitepoint.com/scroll-based-animations-jquery-css3/)
